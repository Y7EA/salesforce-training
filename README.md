This repository is dedicated to enhancing your backend skills and knowledge in Salesforce. In this training, we will explore different aspects of Salesforce, building a solid foundation and gaining hands-on experience through practical exercises and projects.

## Daily Coding Challenges
To reinforce our learning and put our skills to the test, we will have daily Apex coding challenges. These challenges will challenge us to apply our knowledge and problem-solving abilities. Let's have fun while sharpening our coding skills! ðŸ¦¾

## Learning Resources
To support our training, we will leverage the following learning resources:

- [**Salesforce Trailhead**](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/trails/force_com_dev_beginner): Trailhead is Salesforce's online learning platform, offering interactive modules and trails for beginners.
